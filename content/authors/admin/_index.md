#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## Biography

I am a tenure-track assistant professor in digital agriculture with [School of Plant, Environmental and Soil Sciences](https://www.lsu.edu/agriculture/spess/index.php) at the [Louisiana State University AgCenter](https://www.lsuagcenter.com/) and [Louisiana State University](https://www.lsu.edu), where I lead the Ecosystem Sensing and Modeling Lab (ESML). My research integrates remote sensing, artificial intelligence, computational modeling, and statistical analysis to address critical issues in food/energy security, sustainable agriculture, climate change, and beyond.

With a focus on enhancing crop production and resource efficiency, I am interested in developing data-driven solutions to optimize agricultural management and reduce environmental impacts. Guided by the principle that “we can only manage what we can measure well,” my research aims to provide precise, actionable insights that contribute to a sustainable future. I am passionate about combining technology with practical solutions to build resilient agricultural systems for the next generation.

Prior to joining LSU, I also served as a United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO) Artificial Intelligence Specialist, where I contributed to global efforts to integrate AI and digital tools into sustainable agricultural practices. My work at FAO emphasized the use of digital technologies to enhance food and energy security, aiming to build resilient agricultural systems that balance productivity and environmental sustainability.

I am currently looking for MS and PhD students and visiting students and scholars (refer to [We Are Hiring] (https://pengfuag.github.io/hiring/) Page) who are interested in data-driven agriculture to work in the ESML.
